Vibe-coding adventures - you can just ship and share things these days.

Last week on Tuesday I went down to London for a Vibe-coding hackathon (https://lnkd.in/eZUn8b3s) sponsored by Cursor and hosted in the Granola offices.

It was intense - and lasted only two hours. But locking myself in a phone booth and scything through seemingly never-ending Xcode permission errors paid off. I came third as voted by the audience!

I frequently think of retorts when listening to a speaker, especially after the right moment to make a point, when the conversation shifts to a different topic. So, I built a prototype of an iPhone app written in native Swift, called "Critiq", which listens to live audio and displays logical contradictions in the speaker's arguments in near real-time. This was the first time I had ever worked with Xcode for local development, which is truly a testament to how AI tools like Cursor can fuel our output.

I got a shoutout saying that it should be a Granola feature and saw some of the Granola engineers looking at each other, maybe thinking the same… (Nyal Sadiq 👀 ) let's see!

Thanks to Shreman Shrestha for pointing this event out to me, Ash Prabaker from Iterate for organising, Tikhon Belousko for some last-minute support to get screen sharing from my iPhone working on the big screen for the demo, and Granola for hosting us at their Shoreditch office.
