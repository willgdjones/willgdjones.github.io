Update!

After 7 years as cofounder and CTO, I have decided to close my chapter at Sano.

What began as a side project with Patrick and Charlotte during our PhDs has grown into something I had only dreamed of, and it has been a rollercoaster. We now proudly support research programs at four of the world's top-twenty global pharma companies and a full roster of late-stage biotech companies rolling out some incredible new therapies.

I am proud of the whole team at Sano, who continue the mission to accelerate the world's transition to personalised medicines.

There have been plenty of highs, many lows, lots of wins, and lots of learnings. It has been a difficult decision to step away, but I know it's the right move and that the team is well-positioned for future success.

I will continue at Sano as an advisor, and I plan to cast a wide net and explore before committing to a new chapter. If you're in London, let's grab lunch.

For the time being, you'll find me:
Exploring new technology and posting what I learn on X (@willgdjones) and writing longer form pieces at willgdjones.com
Attending as many London hackathons as I can
Vibe coding video games with my two young boys
Taking on some (very!) exciting fixed-term AI consulting/contractor positions

Looking forward to what 2026 brings 🚀
