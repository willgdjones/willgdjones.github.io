I released DocTweak v0.2 - which introduces two new modes of operation: Critique and Replace.

### Critique Mode
Sometimes you don't want direct changes - you want feedback. Maybe you're wondering if a paragraph is clear enough, or if your tone is appropriate for your audience. Critique mode is designed for these moments. Simply select your text, ask your question, and get focused, actionable feedback without any automatic changes to your document.

### Replace Mode
When you're ready for concrete improvements, Replace mode is your go-to option. It provides AI-suggested rewrites of your selected text, with a clear preview and the control to apply changes when you're satisfied with the suggestion.
