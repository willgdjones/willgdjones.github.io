I am the CTO and cofounder of [Sano Genetics](https://sanogenetics.com/). We build software to drive down the cost of running precision medicine research, and help precision medicine developers complete their trials faster.

Previously I studied Mathematics at UCL, Computer Science at Cambridge, and was a postgraduate researcher in Machine Learning and Genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

I love to build and share little prototypes using new technology. Please reach out to me if anything resonates with you I am sure I would love to meet you!
