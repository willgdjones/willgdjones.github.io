Right now, I am figuring out the future and building what should exist.

Between 2018-2025, I was CTO and cofounder of [Sano Genetics](https://sanogenetics.com/), building software to drive down the cost of running precision medicine research, and help precision medicine developers complete their trials faster. I remain an advisor and board member. We have raised £20M, hit £5M in revenue, and serve 4/20 of the top global pharma companies. As CTO, I wrote the first line of code and built a 20-strong, mission-driven eng team from the ground up.

Previously, I studied Mathematics at UCL (top 10 first) and Computer Science at Cambridge (Distinction), and I was a postgraduate researcher in Machine Learning and Genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

I love building and sharing small prototypes using new technologies. Please reach out to me if anything resonates with you I am sure I would love to meet you.

I operate AI consultancy projects via my company, Perihelion Limited, company number 16927629.

Areas I provide 10x the value I charge:
- How your business can win with AI
- Early-stage CTO coaching. Hiring, culture and technical strategy.
- 0->1 Product Engineering
