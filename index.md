Figuring out the future and building what should exist.

Between 2018 and 2025, I was CTO and cofounder of Sano Genetics, and built software to reduce the cost of running precision medicine research, helping precision medicine developers complete their trials faster. Sano proudly supports research programs at four of the world’s top-twenty global pharma companies and a full roster of late-stage biotech companies rolling out some incredible new therapies. As CTO, I wrote the first line of code and built a 20-strong, mission-driven eng team from the ground up.  I remain an advisor and board member.

Previously, I studied Mathematics at UCL (top 10 first) and Computer Science at Cambridge (Distinction), and I was a postgraduate researcher in Machine Learning and Genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

I love building and sharing small prototypes using new technology. Please reach out to me if anything resonates with you. I am sure I would love to meet you.

I operate AI consultancy projects through my company, Perihelion Limited (company number 16927629).

Areas I provide 10x the value I charge:

- How your business can win with AI
- Early-stage CTO coaching. Hiring, culture and technical strategy.
- 0->1 Product Engineering
