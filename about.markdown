I am CTO and cofounder of Sano Genetics. We have been driving down the cost of running precision medicine research and helping precision medicine developers complete their trials faster for five years now.

Previously I studied Math at UCL, Computer Science at Cambridge, and did postgraduate research in machine learning and genetics at the Sanger Institute.

I love to build and share little prototypes using new technology --- Please reach out to me if anything resonates with you I'm sure I'd love to meet you!
